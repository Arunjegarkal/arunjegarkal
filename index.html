              <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
              <p>Introduction</p>
			  <p>
			  This project is focused on building a model for the researcher to collect tweets using Twitter API and analyze the trends in Twitter across Texas counties using hashtags to find the topics people are discussing every day. As hashtags are metadata, they help to recognize topic discussion at a first glance. Analyzing the evolution of topics over time shows how a discussion increases or fades away when new topics emerge. Discussions can also be suddenly switched to new topics. Human discussion behaviors can be studied through this type of analysis of topic evolution. Part of this analysis is frequency distribution of the hashtags which is calculated to highlight the use of the hashtags for each day. Another part of this analysis is applying topic modeling algorithms to tweets to bring out the generalized view point of the tweets. Over all tweets, conclusions are  difficult to derive as many tweets consist of diverse topics; thus, topic analysis methods applied
				on a smaller set of tweets pertaining to hashtags shows more uniformity of thought in the
				tweets. These topics and hashtags are mapped to their respective county on a daily and weekly
				basis to find the co-occurring and identical discussion across the state of Texas. Further, to
				know the opinion of tweeters on these topics, tweets related to the hashtags are extracted and
				the sentiment, positive or negative, of each tweet is calculated using supervised machine
				learning algorithms. These positive and negative sentiment tweets are mapped to their
				respective county to find tweeter perspectives on the topics at each county level; thus, enabling
				researchers to factor in tweet analysis to their geospatial research of disease indicators,
				governmental policy issues, and social norms.</p>

			  <p>
			  In this project, we basically focus to overcome the limitations of the existing techniques and our primary goal is to provide the support for fully transactional communication between the clients and the eventbus thereby making the communication more effective.
			  
			  Websockets replaces the native socket and multithreading concepts of java, which is the efficient way of establishing the pub-sub connection. Serialized the message delivery between publisher-eventbus-subscriber by using ‘Avro’ which is one of the serialization techniques used in hadoop.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
              <p>Introduction</p>
			  <p>
			  This project is about implementation of Gnutella-style peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system, where signal peer act as both client and server with performing the file search within the specified network without using the Indexing server. I have implemented using java socket programming and multithreading concepts. When peer is started its respected server thread is started which runs in the background, given config file is read to find its peer and starts the client thread for each neighbor and when the neighboring peer gets online connection is established this connection is used to search file among the network. Server thread is used to search file within its local directory and store the result into the list once the local search is performed it reads the config file to start the client thread to all its neighbors. time-to-live (TTL) is attached to the message along with the filename need to be searched. TTL is used for preventing query messages from being forwarded infinitely many times. Client thread is used to send the file to search to servers which are connected to it. Server Download thread performs the downloading of file from the peer which is selected by the user. Same server and client threads are used for broadcasting the file modification message to all the neighboring peers which has that modified file. </p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
              <p>Introduction</p>
			  <p>
			  I have used Socket Implementation of Napster-style peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system. The main idea of this project is to Create the indexing server which stores all the file details and bringing it online so that all the peers connect to it and register its files on the server. Once files are registered it provided with 2 option to search for the file in other peer or can exit the execution, if search is selected file name is asked and port number and sent to the server, sever will return the peer id’s which as the respected file and then client has to select the peer id from which file to be downloaded. Downloaded file will be stored into the requested peer’s shared directory. Every Peer can provide its shared director and can register its files so that other peer’s can search and download them.
			  
			  Every Client Server connection is done using Sockets, given the port number and the Server name client establishes a connection with the Server registering files and searching files among peers.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
              <p>Introduction</p>
			  <p>
			  Virtual PC Viewer is a remote control system which allows the user to view and interact with one computer (“remote desktop machine”) to cellular phones (“viewer”) using wireless internet connection. A viewer is provided on the cellular phone that enables the user to see and manipulate the desktop of various remote systems such as Windows operating system. The system to be accessed must be running a Virtual PC Viewer server and it must be attached to a network.	</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>Description</p>
			  <p>
			  Virtual PC Viewer is a client server mobile application and is an ultra-thin client system based on a simple display protocol that is platform independent. This software allows to communicate with the remote system and can have control on the peripheral devices like key board, mouse from the cellular phones. The remote system’s administration tasks can also be performed from the cellular phone. Popular uses for this technology include remote technical support and accessing files on one's work computer to the mobile device. Here the mobile device will act as client and remote machine is called server The user of Virtual PC Viewer has to register at client machine before connecting to server. Registered user can connect to the remote desktop machine through IP address and PORT number of remote desktop machine. After successful connection user can access remote desktop machine. Android native code is used to make client-server communication and better User Interface is provided to make the application user friendly.</p>
			  
			  <p>Application</p>
			  <p>
			  One of the primary application of this project is being able to access, operate a computer remotely from the mobile as if remote machine is in your hand, User can access virtual files from remote machine to mobile device.</p>

			  <p>Description</p>
			  <p>
			  The Project “Doodle Blink” is a test of accuracy, strength and concentration. This is developed platform HTML5 and with the support of Phonegap. Doodle Blink game is the task completion game in which the doodle (person) will be always blinking, the doodle will be on the skating board will be with the doodle till the end of the task competition, for each of the task completion there will be the restricted time, the task contains the obstacles etc. Doodle blink a contiguous game in which doodle is always blinking and Instead the user needs to jump doodle to skip the obstacles and in the first level obstacles are less and speed is also less and we have to score 1000 points then will go for second level in this obstacles are more and speed is also more and for going the third level we have score 3000 points and in this level we have collect the positive points. In score board consists of highest top 4 score will be displayed.</p>
